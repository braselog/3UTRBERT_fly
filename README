Set up the environment for the project by running the following commands:
```bash
  conda create -n 3UTRBERT --file 3UTRBERT_hist.yaml
  conda activate 3UTRBERT
  git clone https://github.com/yangyn533/3UTRBERT
  ln -s $( readlink -f 3UTRBERT/functions/src/ ) scripts/ # this make importing certain functions possible
  cd 3UTRBERT
  sed -i 's/"pybedtools",/#"pybedtools",/g' setup.py # pybedtools is not installing properly this time around, but i don't think it's necessary for the project
  python3 -m pip install --editable .
  cd ..
```
